description: "Caesar's Column: A Story of the Twentieth Century is a novel by Ignatius\
  \ Donnelly, famous as the author of Atlantis: The Antediluvian World. Caesar's Column\
  \ was published pseudonymously in 1890. The book has been variously categorized\
  \ as science fiction, speculative fiction, dystopian fiction, and/or apocalyptic\
  \ fiction; one critic has termed it an \"Apocalyptic Utopia.\"\nThe book is also\
  \ a political novel, and a romance. It was a popular success as well, selling 60,000\
  \ copies upon its initial publication. Its sales eventually comprised 250,000 copies.\
  \ Donnelly's novel was one element of the great wave of utopian and dystopian literature\
  \ during the later nineteenth century and the early twentieth, exemplified by works\
  \ like Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and Jack London's The Iron Heel.\n\n\n\
